            <p>{`Howdy. I'm a software engineer with a strong foundation in bookworm-ery (i.e. a bachelor's degree in English) and a background working in mental health. Together, my education and work experience have instilled me with a love for PROCESS. I enjoy finding things that work for people - be they products, systems, or mindsets - and engaging in a process to make those things work better. This often (actually, always) requires collaboration, so I am big on teamwork and communication. I've found that software engineering is pretty crazy conducive to just this kind of work. I stay stoked for opportunities to write meaningful code.` }</p>
