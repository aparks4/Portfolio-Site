            <p>{`I'm a software engineer with a bachelor's degree in English and a background working in mental health. Both my education and my work experience have instilled me with a love for PROCESS. I enjoy finding things that work for people - be they products, systems, or mindsets - and engaging in a process to make those things work better. This often (really always) requires collaboration, so I am big on teamwork and communication. I've found that software engineering is pretty crazy conducive to just this kind of work. I stay stoked on opportunities to write meaningful code.`}</p>
